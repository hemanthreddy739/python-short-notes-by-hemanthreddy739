==> in pandas there are 2 forms :- 
     1) series <==> list_form <==> 1-dimensional <==> single_column
     2) dataFrame <==> 2-dimensional


==> it is possible to iterate through the rows of an data_frame using "iterrows()"
	## for(index,row) in df.iterrows():
			print(row)



==> formating a floating point number upto the required number of decimals :-
============================================================================

n = 22.34567
need to 3 decimals
print("%.3f" %n)

OR

round(n,3)  --> round of to 3 digits.




JUPITER-NOTE BOOK:-    works in online mode the code would run on the server.
---------------------
--> the cells are of 2 types [code,and text/marked]
--> shift+enter => to run a cell.
--> the text in text cell can be formated
                 --> # heading => gives big heading
                 --> ## some how small
---> ne-5 => n*10power-5
-->booleans are auto-matically converted into integers when u used along with arithematic expression.
-->\ => escape character ,it helps in neglecting the next character after it.
--> \,\n in the string are treated as 1 character in the string.
--> ''.join(str1) is better than concatination --> ''+str1 
--> f"something {num}" ==> formated_message = "the something {}"
                           ffm = formated_message.format(num)
--> another way to create dictionary ==> dictionary_name = dict(key=value,key= value)
--> dictionary_name[key] --> used to acess the dictionary value,but raise error if it is not present in the
       dictionary.
-->dictionary_name.get(key) -->gives None if that key is not present 
-->dictionary_name.get(key,default_value) -->gives default_value if that key is not present.
-->%%time --> is uesd to calculate the time taken to execute the cell in Jupyter notebook.

--> in the functions , make sure that all the optional arguments i.e the arguments with default
       value,should be mentioned at last.
--> to install module in jupyter-notebook 
         ==> !pip install numpy --upgrade --quiet
--> the numpy arrays elements can be acessed as numpy_array_name[index]
--> to get dot product of 2 numpy arrays 
             ==> let say n1,n2 be numpy arrays
                       dot_product_result = numpy.dot(n1,n2)
--> it can be done in another way 
          ==> dot_product_result = (n1*n2)-->return an array .sum()

--> numpy_array_name.shape() ==> gives the shape (row,col,width)
--> a 3d numpy array is nothing but putting 2 numpy 2d arrays side by side.

--> to get shape of an any nd array just start fro outer step then count number of elements
       , then move one step inside then count the no_of_elements,them again move one step inside
            then again find the no_of_elements and so on .....
       ===> thus u get the shape.
--> python primitive data types can hold wide range of values,
    but the numpy limits like 'int64' some-thing it means it can hold at max 64 bits.

       --> to check data type of the in numpy 
             --> numpy_variable.dtype


--> matrix multiplication in numpy
======================================
     --> let say there would be two matrixs m1,m2 them matrix multiplication 
              import numpy as np
          
                  ==> Mm = np.matmul(m1,m2)
                          [or]
                  ==> Mm = m1 @ m2

climate_data_from_file = np.genfromtxt('climate.txt',delimiter=',',skip_header=1) 
          --> the genfromtxt() => gives an numpyarray .

===> concatinating 2 numpy arrays :-
let say [n1]4*3 and [n2]4*1  ---> no_of_rows should be comman  if concatinating paralell ,axis =1
                                  no_of_cols should be common  if concatinating horizontal, axis =0
==> res = np.concatenate((n1,n2),axis = 1)

==> to reshape the array 
        numpy_variable_array.reshape(10,20) 


===> to write into the csv file using numpy function :-
=========================================================

np.savetxt('file_name',variable_holding_the_data_need_to_save,
                  header ='hd1,hd2',
                  fmt ='%.2f',
                  comments = '')


==> Arithimetic operations on numpy arrays:-
=============================================

let say n1,n2  are numpy arrays

res = n1+n2 --> corresponding elements are added.(if both n1,n2 are of same dimensions. 
        it is direct process)
                                                
       if - in place of + then same 
res = n1*5 --> every element is multiplied by 5.
        same for others inplace of * if %,/ 

internally the process going is if the matrices are compatible i.e [n1]m*n ; [n2]n*m

===========best example=======
ar2 = np.array(
    [2,3,5]
)
ar2.shape --> gives (3,)

==> if the matrixes is compatible then it may possible:-
         EX:-
             import numpy as np
	        		ar1 = np.array([
   					 [10,20,30],
   					 [40,50,60]
				])
			ar2 = np.array(
    					[2,3,5]
				)
			ar2.shape --> gives (3,)


			rr = ar1+ar2S
                  output:-
                 =========
			array([[12, 23, 35],
         			[42, 53, 65]])


                   

==> the numpy arrays also support comparison operators and returns a array of boolean 
     it means the operator is  applied on every corresponding elements of the 2 arrays and return
            array of boolean 
--> booleans are automatically converted into 1 or 0, when used with arithimatic operators.
             let say n1,n2 be two arrays 
        ==> (n<=n2).sum()  --> it gives the count which satisfied the  condition.



==>NUMPY ARRAY INDEXING:-
--------------------------
--> you can pass a single value or a comma separated index value to acess more than one element
    and also you can acess a range of elements.

     let us assue the numpy array 'N' be of 3d then indexing would be:-
                  the index would be one/two's/three's
                  EX:-N[1,2:,3] --> we can use single index value or slicing.

--> some special matrices :-
    =========================
     np.zeroes/ones(shape_in_tuple/list)
     np.eye(shape_as_an_arguments_separated_by ,)  ---> it gives the identity matrix
     np.random.rand(shape)
     np.random.randn(shape_as_an argument separated by ,) --> has mean of 0 and std of 1
               
     let say the numpy array 'n'
     n.reshape(2,3,-1)  --> if u leave any one as -1 then numpy will automatically calculate
                            it's value based the total elements and the rest of values in shape.

     np.arange(starting_value,ending_value,step_size)
     np.linspace(starting_value,ending_value,no_of_elemnts_you_want) --> eually spaced.
     ---> in arange the ending_value is not included but in linspace it is included. 



==> OS MODULE:-
=================
os.getcwd()  --> gives the path of the current working directory
os.listdir('.')  -->relative path , 'absolute-path' -->gives the list of all files in that directory.
        ==> it returns a list.
os.makedirs('directory_name',exist_ok = True) --> exist_ok --> if it is False then it raise an error
                                               if that file is already exist,if it True than it 
                                               doesn't raise any error.


===>PANDAS:-
==============
--> PANDAS give an 'object' data_type(a generic one) for an feature in case if the pandas is unable
    to determine the data_type of that column (for all strings it is object)
--> df = pd.read_csv('file_path')
    ---> methods 
         --------
       df.info()   --> gives the brief information about the data set.
       df.describe()  --> overview of the numerical colums i.e some statastical information
                          --> the count it giving is the number of non empty cells in that column.
       df.columns     --> gives list of column names.
       df.shape  --> gives the no.of rows and cols
       df[colum_name] -->gives the complete column values it seems that it is a array or list
                         of values,but it is an 'series' type.
                       <==>df.column_name
       --> to retrieve an specific cell value in the column 
             we use df[column_name][cell_number] 
          short cut.  --> df.at[cell_number/nothing but row number,column_name]
 
      --> inorder to retrieve the more than one column then u need to pass a list of column in 
              indexing  i.e df[[col1,col2]]

--> to make a copy of the data_frame 
    dfc = df.copy()
--> to retrieve a row completely then --> df.loc[row_number] --> it is also a 'series' type.
--> when there is no value in the csv file then pandas insert 'nan' value into the data_frame.
     --> it is different from 0 ,thats why when you check the type of nan value it gives --> float type.

--> if there is continous 'nan' values in an column of an data frame then to know from which row the 'real_values' will start
     then => df.column_name.first_valid_index()
--> to get random number of rows i.e completely random -->df.sample(no_of_rows)
--> df.colum_name.sum()

--> getting the rows that meet the required condition
   high_from_new_cases = dfc.new_cases > 1000
   df_as_pr_cond = dfc[high_from_new_cases]
   df_as_pr_cond

--> to display more i.e maximum no of rows in output then.
   from IPython.display import display
   with pd.option_context( 'display.max_rows',100):
        display(df)

--> to put back a column into a data_frame --> df['column_name']=value_column

--> to drop an column from data frame => df.drop(columns=['ratio'],inplace = True) 
         --> the 'inplace' attribute if it is true then the original data_frame is modified.
--> sorting the data_frame based on the column(s) .
     df.sort_values(['new_cases','date'],ascending=[False,True]).head(10) 
           --> it means sort column1 in descending order,and col2 in ascendng_order.
--> modifying a cell based on the pre and next cell value to clear the outlier.
	import math
	dfc.at[172,'new_cases'] = math.ceil((dfc.at[171,'new_cases']+dfc.at[173,'new_cases'])/2)
--> to drop more than one row from a data_frame
       dmy = dfc.loc[165:190].drop(list(range(170,181)),inplace=True)

--> changing into a 'datetime' => df['date'] = pandas.to_datetime(df.date)

--> dfc['year'] = p.DatetimeIndex(dfc.date).year/month/day/weekday

--> groupby method:-
     ================
          grpmethod = df.groupby(on_which_feature_df_shoud_be_grouped)--> it is an intermediate
                               data_frame u can perform aggregate functions on it like:-sum(),mean(),count()
--> another form of method used for aggregation is --> cumsum => cumulative_sum.

--> MERGE:-   to merge data_frames at least they should have one common column.
============
merged_df = df1.merge(df2,on='common_column_name')


--> benifits of pandas over the sql is we can't combine the sal data_table with an csv file .
    -- > but in pandas we can combine a data_frame from json and a data_frame from csv.

-->data_frame_series.unique()  --> gives the unique values.
--> drawing graphs using plot() :-
===================================
==> setting desired index to the data_frame --> df.set_index('desired_col_as_index')
data_frame_series.plot() 



==> VISUALISATION WITH MATPLOTLIB AND SEABORN :-
=================================================
--> seaborn is build on top of matplotlib.
--> the => %matplotlib inline <=> tells to u r jupyter not to show u r outputs as pop-ups 
     show it in below the code.
    --> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
         # plt.plot(data_frame_series); --> the semi-colan removes showing up of unwanted output function calls.



==>Styling Lines and Markers
The plt.plot function supports many arguments for styling lines and markers:

color or c: Set the color of the line (supported colors)
linestyle or ls: Choose between a solid or dashed line
linewidth or lw: Set the width of a line
markersize or ms: Set the size of markers
markeredgecolor or mec: Set the edge color for markers
markeredgewidth or mew: Set the edge width for markers
markerfacecolor or mfc: Set the fill color for markers
alpha: Opacity of the plot

-->fmt = '[marker_shape][line][color]'

--> to change the window size of the plot.
==> plt.figure(figsize = (8,4))
--> import matplotlib as m
     m.rcParams 
       ---> it gives the list of parameters and their default values u can also change
             u r wish.


==> import seaborn as sb
df = sb.load_dataset('data_setpath')
sb.scatterplot(df.colm_name_for_x,similar_for_y)
                     # hue = parameter used for segregation.
       ## another way
df = pd.read_csv('csv_file_path')

sb.scatterplot('col_for_x','col_for_y',...,data=df)

===>discription on what the various graphs tells about:-
==========================================================
 >> line_chart shows the overview of the situation.
 >> bar graph enables to compare one instance with other.
 >> histogram oka field gurinchi and in that too oka field lo oka range lo enni vunnai anna 
    dani gurinchi.
 

===> pil ==> python imaging library.








             
about urllib module:-
=======================

import urllib.request as u

varble = u.urlopen('https://www.google.com')    -->makes an request to that specified website.

print(varble.read())  --> prints the data it read.

---> to download:-
===================
climate_data = u.urlretrieve('https://gist.github.com/BirajCoder/a4ffcb76fd6fb221d76ac2ee2b8584e9/raw/4054f90adfd361b7aa4255e99c2e874664094cea/climate.csv', 
    'climate.txt')

==> in python files the binary_mode [b] is used when we working with non-text files like
            images etc
==> need of closing the file --> when u open a file it will be placed on the ram if u not 
close the file it will eatup u r ram.
==> str.strip() --> strip() is used to remove the spaces at begining ,ending and new line character.

==> file_obj.readlines()  --> it returns the file contents (line by line) into a list as elements.
